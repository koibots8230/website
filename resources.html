            <br>
            Your whole robot depends on these. You need to know a lot about them, but first and foremost you need to know if they have the power to do what you want and then how to attach both the motor and the shaft to whatever it is you want to power.
            <br>

                A <a href="https://www.chiefdelphi.com/uploads/default/original/3X/d/2/d2495ff57e402e93bb479171750bb6b05ec8e594.pdf">Primer on Motors</a> from <a href="http://www.chiefdelphi.com">Chief Delphi</a>. You might be able to stop with just reading this 25 page document, which has lots of good links at the bottom.

            A good frame of reference is this: everything in your car runs off of 12 volts, as does your robot. So all the things that move in your car are done with 12v motors. This includes mirrors, sunroofs, windows, doors, seats, windshield wipers, etc.
            <img src="images/image2.png" alt="Gearbox" style="width: 20vw; float:left; padding-top:1vh; padding-right: 2vw;">

            <span>
                Gearboxes will take what is typically an extremely fast motor (18,000 rpm) with low torque, and change it to a more useful output of speed and torque.These typically fall into two broad categories, planetary gearboxes and open gearboxes. Planetary gear sets screw directly to the motor making them very convenient; they are also easy to get just the right gear ratio. Some gearboxes have shifting capabilities as well, typically used for drivetrains where high speed across the field and low torque or precise maneuvering are needed at the destination.
            </span>

            <br>
            <br>
            This image above is a Versa planetary gearbox. The motor would be mounted to the right and the output shaft on the left. Which brings up the next issue with motors, how to attach to the output shaft and how to mount the motor?

            <h2>First Task in learning Onshape for Robotics</h2>
            <br><br>
            We don’t know where you are with CAD, so as a start with this:
            <br><br>
            Use the resources provided by Onshape to learn what you don’t know.
            <img class="center_img" src="images/image3.png" alt="learning center">
            <img style="width: 50vw;" src="images/image5.png" alt="learning pathways" class="center_img">
            You also have access to Mr. Nystrom who can answer most of your questions the fastest. But that presumes he’s available. So always be able to teach yourself what you don’t know.
            <div class="border_box">Do your CAD in our Onshape team folder called TRAINING. Name the file like mine: 8020 Wire Management: Nystrom</div>
            <br>
            <h3>Task 1</h3>
            <p><img style="float: right;" src="images/image4.jpg" alt="8020">Aluminum gets extruded in lots of unique profile shapes, one of which is called 8020 and looks like this. It is used a lot in robotics because it’s easy to put together and attach things to. It’s also very strong for its weight. <p class="border_box" style="margin: 0px 250px 0px 0px;">Your objective is to make a 3D printed part<br> that will help the electricians on the team with wire management by fitting into the grooves of the 8020.</p> </p>
            <h3>Suggestions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li class="li_space">Go to <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/structural-framing/framing-type~t-slot-1/t-slotted-framing-rails/">McMaster Carr</a> and download/import the CAD file into your Onshape file. <br> Here’s a video showing how to <a href="https://watch.screencastify.com/v/6T5eCG3vEiwA05t7xX7s">Import from McMaster Carr into Onshape</a>.</li>
                <li class="li_space">Do an Image search online to find possibilities. I just typed in ‘8020 cable management’. I encourage you to be unique … but honestly in most cases the goal is to just ‘get the job done’, so duplicating the work of others is encouraged because it ‘gets the job done’ the fastest.</li>
